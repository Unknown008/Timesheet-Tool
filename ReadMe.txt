This directory contains version 1.0 of Timesheet Tool.

Timesheet Tool is an app that can be used to keep track of all the time
spent on a particular engagement code throughout any designated period
of time. Since the current online tool does not allow reports per code
or per particular status, this will act as an aid to exactly do that
and be able to pinpoint the dates on which certain codes were charged
to and the exact number of hours recorded on same. Hopefully, the long
hours spent to make sure the correct codes and hours recorded are correct
will be easier.
